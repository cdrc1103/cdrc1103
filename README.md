# Welcome to my Github Page! ‚úåÔ∏è

I am a Data Scientist / Engineer, currently working as consultant for Enterprise Data and Analytics at Capgemini. In my current role, my work is dedicated to analyzing client data, bringing alive data-driven software, implementing data pipelines and machine learning lifecycles, and designing cloud architectures. I focus on Natural Language Processing use cases and help clients to bring their AI prototypes to production by applying automation and MLOps tools.


Below, you can find a digest of the projects I am currently working on or have finished in the past.
 
## ML Demonstrators

  | Name   | Use Case | Tech Stack |
  |:---:   | :---: | :---
  | [Speech Transcription](https://github.com/cdrc1103/SpeechTranscription) | Speech transcription using Azure cloud resources |`Azure SDK`, `Streamlit`|
  | [Object Detection](https://github.com/cdrc1103/ObjectDetection) | FastAPI backend serving YOLO predictions on objects detected in images|`FastAPI`, `Streamlit`, `TensorFlow`|
  | [Named Entity Recognition](https://github.com/cdrc1103/NER/tree/main/BERT)| Recognize entities in text using the BERT model | `Transformers`, `PyTorch`|

## Academic Projects

  | Name   | Project | Year | Tech Stack | Description
  |:---:   | :---: | :---: | :---: |:---
  | [Patent Classifier](https://github.com/cdrc1103/PatentClassifier) | Multi-Label Patent Classification with Deep Neural Networks |2021| `TensorFlow`, `Transformers` |A comprehensive study to identify, implement and evaluate suitable approaches for the classification of patents using different neural network architectures like CNN, RNN, and Transformers. A domain-specific data set of 200.000 patent documents is used.
  | [Crowdedness Prediction](https://github.com/cdrc1103/CrowdednessPrediction) | Crowdedness Prediction in Public Transport Under Covid-19 |2020|`PyTorch`| During Covid-19 pandemic social distancing in public transport is an important matter to prevent spreading the virus. Thus, it would be beneficial to know when and where there are bottlenecks in the public transport network. Our goal is to reduce the capacity problem by predicting the crowdedness for a specified time interval with RNNs.

## Portfolio Optimization
