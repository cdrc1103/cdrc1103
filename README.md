  | [Master Thesis](https://github.com/cdrc1103/MasterThesis) | Multi-Label Classification for Cosmetic Patents Using Neural Networks |2021|The aim of this thesis is to identify, implement and evaluate suitable approaches for the classification of patents in the cosmetic domain using neural networks. For this purpose, a patent collection provided by the company Beiersdorf is used as application case.
  | [Deep Learning Course Project](https://github.com/cdrc1103/DL_Project13e) | Crowdedness Prediction in Public Transport Under Covid-19 |2020| During Covid-19 pandemic social distancing in public transport is an important matter to prevent spreading the virus. Thus, it would be beneficial to know when and where there are bottlenecks in the public transport network. Our goal is to reduce the capacity problem by predicting the crowdedness for a specified time interval with RNNs.
