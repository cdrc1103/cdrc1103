# Welcome to my Github Page! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer passionate about deep neural networks, natural language processing, and MLOPs.

**Curious what to find here?**

So far, most of my repos here are references of my academic projects ([Academic Projects](#academic-projects)). Currently, I am working on different demonstrators for machine learning algorithms that I am interested in ([Demonstrators](#demonstrators)).

## Academic Projects

  | Name   | Use Case | Year | Packages | Description
  |:---:   | :---: | :---: | :---: |:---
  | [Patent Classifier](https://github.com/cdrc1103/PatentClassifier) | Multi-Label Patent Classification with Deep Neural Networks |2021| TensorFlow </br>Transformers |A comprehensive study to identify, implement and evaluate suitable approaches for the classification of patents using different neural network architectures like CNN, RNN, and Transformers. A domain-specific data set of 200.000 patent documents is used.
  | [Crowdedness Prediction](https://github.com/cdrc1103/CrowdednessPrediction) | Crowdedness Prediction in Public Transport Under Covid-19 |2020|PyTorch| During Covid-19 pandemic social distancing in public transport is an important matter to prevent spreading the virus. Thus, it would be beneficial to know when and where there are bottlenecks in the public transport network. Our goal is to reduce the capacity problem by predicting the crowdedness for a specified time interval with RNNs.
  
## Use Case Demonstrators

  | Name   | Show Case | Year | Packages|Description
  |:---:   | :---: | :---: | :---:| :---
  | [Object Detection](https://github.com/cdrc1103/ObjectDetection) | ML Algorithm for Production |2022|Streamlit </br> FastAPI| A web app build with a Streamlit frontend that allows the user to upload custom images for object detection. Each image submission triggers a predict workflow processed by a FastAPI backend which eventually returns the image with bounding boxes of the detected objects.
  | [NER with BERT](https://github.com/cdrc1103/NER/tree/main/BERT)| Visualize Entities in Text | 2022 | Gradio </br> Transformers |A Gradio app to perform named entity recognition on input text using the BERT Transformer model.|
